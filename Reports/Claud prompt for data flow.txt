Create a detailed project plan for a fraud detection system using machine learning, with steps for data handling, model training, deployment, and reporting.

This plan will guide you through the entire process, from initial setup to deployment and reporting, ensuring you complete the project within 6 days.

# Steps

1. **Day 1: Project Setup and Data Preparation**
   - Set up a GitHub repository for version control.
   - Load and explore your dataset to understand its structure and features.
   - Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical variables, etc.).
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. **Day 2: Model Selection and Training**
   - Research and select appropriate machine learning models for fraud detection (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, etc.).
   - Train the selected models using the training dataset.
   - Evaluate model performance using the testing dataset and select the best-performing model.

3. **Day 3: Model Optimization and Validation**
   - Fine-tune the model parameters to improve accuracy.
   - Validate the model using cross-validation techniques.
   - Document the model's performance metrics.

4. **Day 4: Deployment Preparation**
   - Set up a Flask or Streamlit application for model deployment.
   - Integrate the trained model into the application.
   - Prepare the application to accept user inputs and return predictions.

5. **Day 5: Database Integration and Continuous Learning**
   - Set up a MySQL database to store user inputs and predictions.
   - Implement functionality to save new data inputs into the database.
   - Develop a script to periodically retrain the model using the updated dataset.

6. **Day 6: Reporting and Dashboard Creation**
   - Create a Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics and model performance.
   - Ensure the dashboard updates with new data from the MySQL database.
   - Finalize documentation and ensure all components are working seamlessly.

# Output Format

Provide a detailed step-by-step project plan in a structured format, such as a numbered list or bullet points, with clear instructions for each day.

# Examples

- **Day 1 Example:**
  - "Set up a GitHub repository named 'FraudDetectionProject'."
  - "Load the dataset using pandas and perform exploratory data analysis to identify key features."

- **Day 2 Example:**
  - "Select logistic regression and random forest models for initial training."
  - "Use scikit-learn to train models and evaluate using accuracy and F1-score."

# Notes

- Ensure each step is completed before moving to the next to maintain project flow.
- Allocate time for troubleshooting and testing at each stage.
- Consider using virtual environments to manage dependencies.
- Regularly commit changes to GitHub to track progress and maintain version control.
